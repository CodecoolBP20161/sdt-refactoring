# SPACE exercise

### What is to be done?

1. Separate PhysicalObject class into an other Maven 'lib' project
2. Space object must be hidden in the application, should not be shared.

#### Expected outcome
 * Write clean, OOP code
 * Boost unit test coverage
 * Get to now different technologies that you did not met before, adapt the code with those
 

### Ideas to refactor
* [EASY] packages
* [EASY] tests - Coverage?!
* [EASY] `main` method
* [MEDIUM] static hell -> OOP code
* [MEDIUM] Color
* [MEDIUM] Space should contain only it's own logic, nothing about display, balls, etc.
* [EXP] Domain logic should be viable without any UI related logic.
